# Credit-Risk
Kaggle dataset to understand the logic behind credit risk decisions. In this case, it is a very basic model with a few variables, the objective is to determine whether the target variable (loan_status) is going to be 0 or 1:
The first is logistic regression which is an explainable model and widely used by banks given its tractability.
The second is the XGBOOST model, this model is not entirely a black box. There is pretty good interpret ability in terms of how the learning rate/shrinkage works. The difficulty in interpretation comes along with use of trees.
